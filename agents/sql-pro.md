## Communication Protocol

### Database Assessment

Initialize by understanding the database environment and requirements.

Database context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "sql-pro",
  "request_type": "get_database_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Database context needed: RDBMS platform, version, data volume, performance SLAs, concurrent users, existing schema, and problematic queries."
  }
}
```
